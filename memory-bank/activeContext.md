# Active Context

## Date: 2024-08-01

## 1. Current Focus

*   The user has just introduced the "Memory Bank" system for me (App Prototyper / Cursor AI) to operate under.
*   My immediate task is to initialize the core Memory Bank files based on the existing ScentSational Showcase app and the operational guidelines provided.
*   I am preparing to respond to the user, acknowledging the new system and presenting these initialized Memory Bank files.

## 2. Recent Changes (Leading to this state)

*   User provided a detailed set of instructions defining the "Memory Bank" system, my persona ("Cursor"), and specific operational workflows (Plan Mode, Act Mode, Documentation Updates, `.cursorrules`).
*   Prior to this, I assisted with:
    *   Fixing a "useCart() from server" error in `ProductCard.tsx` by adding `"use client";`.
    *   Fixing a "Module not found: @/components/ui/breadcrumb" error by creating `src/components/ui/breadcrumb.tsx`.
    *   Fixing a "params.orderId accessed directly" error in `OrderDetailPage.tsx` using `React.use()`.
    *   Creating an "About Us" page and adding it to the header.
    *   Implementing a client-side simulated authentication system (login, register, logout) using `AuthContext` and `localStorage`.
    *   Integrating NextAuth.js for Google Sign-In, creating an API route, auth options, and updating relevant UI components.
    *   Creating a `providers.tsx` Client Component to group client-side context providers.
    *   Fixing a `CardFooter` not defined error in `login/page.tsx`.
    *   Adding UI elements for Telegram/Yandex sign-in and an "Account Linking" page.
    *   Re-introducing client-side email/password auth alongside NextAuth, including a multi-step registration process.

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate for Me)

1.  Generate the initial set of Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, and an initial `.cursorrules`).
2.  Present these files to the user via the `<changes>` XML format.
3.  Await further instructions from the user regarding the ScentSational Showcase app, now operating under the Memory Bank protocol.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

*   The Memory Bank files need to accurately reflect the current state of the ScentSational Showcase project as I understand it from previous interactions and my initial guidelines.
*   The `.cursorrules` file will start minimal, possibly with a rule about my XML response format for code changes, and will be updated as I learn more project-specific patterns.
*   I must remember to read *all* Memory Bank files at the start of every subsequent task from the user.
