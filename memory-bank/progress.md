# Progress: ScentSational Showcase

## Date: 2024-08-01

## 1. What Works (Implemented Features)

*   **Core App Structure:** Next.js App Router, basic layout (Header, Footer).
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS setup, ShadCN UI components available, custom theme in `globals.css` reflecting PRD.
*   **Homepage (`/`):** Displays hero section, category links, featured products, CTA.
*   **Product Listing (`/products`):**
    *   Displays products using `ProductCard`.
    *   Client-side filtering (category, price range, scent, material - based on mock data).
    *   Client-side sorting.
    *   Search functionality (filters product list by name/description).
*   **Product Details Page (`/products/[id]`):**
    *   Displays product details, image gallery, pricing.
    *   "Add to Cart" functionality.
    *   Related products section.
*   **Shopping Cart (`/cart`):**
    *   Displays cart items, quantities, total price.
    *   Allows quantity updates, item removal, clearing cart.
    *   "Proceed to Checkout" and "Continue Shopping" links.
    *   Uses `CartContext` and `localStorage` for persistence.
*   **Checkout Page (`/checkout`):**
    *   Displays order summary.
    *   Form for contact, shipping address, and mock payment details.
    *   Submitting the form (simulated) clears the cart and redirects.
*   **Authentication:**
    *   **NextAuth.js with Google Provider:** Functional for Google sign-in and sign-out. Session management via `useSession`.
    *   **Client-Simulated Email/Password:**
        *   Login page (`/login`) with email/password form.
        *   Multi-step registration page (`/register`) with email/password, personal details, and simulated confirmation.
        *   Logout functionality.
        *   Uses `AuthContext` and `localStorage`.
    *   Placeholders for Telegram & Yandex social login buttons.
*   **User Account Area (`/account/*`):**
    *   Protected: Requires login (either NextAuth or simulated).
    *   **Layout:** Common sidebar navigation (Profile, Addresses, Order History, Account Linking), Logout button.
    *   **Profile Page (`/account/profile`):** Displays user info (name, email from session/context), form to "update" (client-side demo).
    *   **Addresses Page (`/account/addresses`):** UI for managing shipping addresses (add, edit, delete, set default - mock data).
    *   **Order History Page (`/account/orders`):** Lists mock past orders, links to order details.
    *   **Order Detail Page (`/account/orders/[orderId]`):** Displays details of a specific mock order.
    *   **Account Linking Page (`/account/linking`):** UI to show linked accounts (Google via NextAuth) and placeholders for linking others.
*   **About Us Page (`/about`):** Static content page.
*   **UI Components:** Extensive use of ShadCN UI components, custom `Logo` component.
*   **Context Providers:** `SessionProvider` (NextAuth), `SimulatedAuthProvider` (custom), `CartProvider`, `Toaster` grouped in `providers.tsx`.
*   **Error Handling:** Some client-side toast notifications for user feedback.

## 2. What's Left to Build (Based on PRD & Common E-commerce Features)

*   **Full Backend Integration:**
    *   Database for products, users, orders, addresses.
    *   Real authentication backend (instead of/complementing client-side simulation for email/password).
    *   API endpoints for all CRUD operations.
*   **Payment Processing:** Stripe integration for actual payments.
*   **Genkit AI Features:** No specific Genkit AI features have been implemented yet beyond initial setup files.
*   **Image Handling:** Replace placeholders with actual image uploads/management.
*   **Inventory Management:** Real stock updates.
*   **Search:** Server-side search for better performance and accuracy.
*   **Filtering/Sorting:** Server-side implementation for product lists.
*   **User Account Features (Backend):**
    *   Saving profile updates, addresses.
    *   Real order history.
    *   Password reset functionality for email/password auth.
    *   Actual account linking logic.
*   **Admin Panel:** For managing products, orders, users.
*   **Email Notifications:** Order confirmations, shipping updates, etc.
*   **Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
*   **Deployment:** Configuration for production deployment.
*   **Further UI/UX Refinements.**

## 3. Current Status

*   The application is an MVP with many core e-commerce UI flows implemented.
*   Authentication is hybrid: NextAuth for Google, client-side simulation for email/password.
*   Most data is currently mocked.
*   **Memory Bank system just initialized.**

## 4. Known Issues/Previous Errors Addressed

*   `useCart()` being called from server in `ProductCard.tsx` (fixed with `"use client";`).
*   Missing `Breadcrumb` component (fixed by adding the component file `src/components/ui/breadcrumb.tsx`).
*   Direct access to `params.orderId` in `OrderDetailPage.tsx` (fixed with `React.use()`).
*   `CardFooter` not defined in `login/page.tsx` (fixed by adding import).
*   React Context unavailable in Server Components (addressed by creating `providers.tsx` as a client component).
