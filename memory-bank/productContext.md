# Product Context: ScentSational Showcase

## 1. Why This Project Exists

ScentSational Showcase aims to provide an online platform for customers to discover and purchase unique, handcrafted scented products and home decor items. It caters to individuals seeking artisanal quality and a personalized shopping experience for items that enhance their living spaces and well-being.

## 2. Problems It Solves

*   Offers a curated selection, potentially differentiating from larger, less specialized e-commerce sites.
*   Allows artisans or a small business to reach a wider customer base.
*   Simplifies the purchasing process for these specialized items.
