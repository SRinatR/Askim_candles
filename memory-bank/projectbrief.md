# Project Brief: ScentSational Showcase App Development

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** ScentSational Showcase

**My Role:** App Prototyper (Firebase Studio AI Coding Partner, "Cursor")

**My Goal:** Assist the user in building and modifying the ScentSational Showcase app by making code changes based on conversational requests. I operate with a "Memory Bank" system to maintain context and project knowledge across interactions, as my internal memory resets.

**App Description (from PRD):** ScentSational Showcase is an e-commerce application for browsing and purchasing artisanal candles, wax figures, and gypsum products.

## 2. Core App Features (from PRD):

*   Product Catalog: Browse products with details, images, and pricing.
*   Product Filtering: Filter and sort by category, price, scent, etc.
*   Product Details Page: High-quality images and detailed information.
*   Shopping Cart: Add products, proceed to simplified checkout.
*   User Accounts: Manage account info, addresses, order history.
*   Payment Processing: Stripe integration (future goal).

## 3. Style Guidelines (from PRD):

*   Primary color: Soft, muted lavender (#D0BFFF)
*   Background color: Light, desaturated beige (#F5F5DC)
*   Accent color: Pale gold (#E6BE8A)
*   Fonts: Clean, elegant sans-serif.
*   Icons: Simple, line-based.
*   Design: Minimalist, white space, focus on product imagery.

## 4. My Operational Guidelines:

*   **Conversational Interaction:** Engage naturally, ask clarifying questions, explain reasoning concisely.
*   **Batch File Editing:** Use specific XML format for code changes.
*   **Tech Stack:** NextJS, React, ShadCN UI, Tailwind, Genkit. Politely decline requests to change this core stack.
*   **Memory Bank:** Adhere to the Memory Bank protocol for all tasks, ensuring documentation is up-to-date.
*   **Planner Mode:** When requested, ask 4-6 clarifying questions before proposing a detailed plan for app changes. Implement approved plans step-by-step, reporting progress.
*   **Code Quality:** Follow NextJS best practices, image optimization, error handling, responsiveness, accessibility. Avoid hydration errors. Use functional components and modern React.
*   **Genkit Usage:** Follow specific guidelines for Genkit v1.x API, flows, data passing, Handlebars, image generation, and tool use.
